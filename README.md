1. Problems

1.1. Problem 1: Two Sum

Description

Given an array of n integers and an integer t, find the indices of the two elements such that they add up to t. The indices of elements in the array are from 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ up to n. Each input would have exactly one solution. You cannot use the same element twice. You need to output the two indices in order from smallest to largest.

Input

‚Ä¢ Line 1: two integers n, t.

‚Ä¢ Line 2: n integers a1, a2, ‚Ä¶, an, representing the integers in the array.

Output

‚Ä¢ Two integers separated by spaces, representing the two indices in order from smallest to largest.

Limits

‚Ä¢ 2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5 √ó 105.

‚Ä¢ ‚àí109 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 109.

‚Ä¢ ‚àí109 ‚â§ ai ‚â§ 109.

Note

‚Ä¢ For 20% data, n ‚â§ 5.

‚Ä¢ For 80% data, n ‚â§ 5000.

‚Ä¢ For 100% data, n ‚â§ 500000.

Sample I

Input Output

1.2. Problem 2: Inversion Number

Description

Input

‚Ä¢ Line 1: one integer n.

‚Ä¢ Line 2: n integers a1, a2, ‚Ä¶, an, representing the integers in the array.

Output

‚Ä¢ One integer representing the number of inversions of the array a.

Limits

‚Ä¢ 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5 √ó 105.

‚Ä¢ ‚àí109 ‚â§ ai ‚â§ 109.

Note

‚Ä¢ For 20% data, n ‚â§ 5.

‚Ä¢ For 80% data, n ‚â§ 5000.

‚Ä¢ For 100% data, n ‚â§ 500000.

Sample I

Input Output

1.3. Problem 3: Line Arrangement

Description

He takes the following approach:

1. The student numbered 1 is placed into the line. Now he is the only one in the line.

2. The students numbered 2 ‚àº n are placed in the line in turn. The teacher designates the student numbered x to stand on the left or the right of one of the students numbered 1 ‚àº x ‚àí 1 (i.e., a student who have been previously placed in the line).

3. Remove m students from the line and remain the order of the other students‚Äô positions unchanged.

After all the students have been arranged in the line as described above, the teacher wants to know the numbers of all the students from left to right.

Input

‚Ä¢ Line 1: one integer n, representing the number of the students.

‚Ä¢ Line 2 to n: two integers xi, pi where i is the line number, representing how students will be placed into the line. If pi = 0, the student numbered xi will stand on the left of the student numbered i. If pi = 1, the student numbered xi will stand on the right of the student numbered i.

‚Ä¢ Line n + 1: one integer m, representing the number of the students to be removed.

‚Ä¢ Line n+2: m integers y1, y2, ‚Ä¶, ym, representing which students will be be removed from the line.

Output

‚Ä¢ n integers separated by spaces, representing the number of all students in the line from left to right.

Limits

‚Ä¢ 2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5 √ó 105.

‚Ä¢ 1 ‚â§ xi &lt; i where i is the line number.

‚Ä¢ pi ‚àà{0,1}.

‚Ä¢ 1 ‚â§ m &lt; n.

‚Ä¢ 1 ‚â§ yi ‚â§ n; yi =Ã∏ yj,‚àÄi =Ã∏ j.

Note

‚Ä¢ For 20% data, n ‚â§ 5.

‚Ä¢ For 80% data, n ‚â§ 5000.

‚Ä¢ For 100% data, n ‚â§ 500000.

Explanation

‚Ä¢ The student numbered 1 is placed into the line. Then the line is [1].

‚Ä¢ The student numbered 2 is placed into the line. He/she stands on the left of the student numbered 1. Then the line is [2,1].

‚Ä¢ The student numbered 3 is placed into the line. He/she stands on the right of the student numbered 2. Then the line is [2,3,1].

‚Ä¢ The student numbered 4 is placed into the line. He/she stands on the left of the student numbered 1. Then the line is [2,3,4,1].

‚Ä¢ The student numbered 3 is removed from the line. Then the line is [2,4,1].

‚Ä¢ The student numbered 4 is removed from the line. Then the line is [2,1].

2. Requirements

You also need to write a report to explain the following:

‚Ä¢ What are the possible solutions for this problem?

‚Ä¢ How do you solve this problem?

‚Ä¢ Why is your solution better than others?

3. Example

3.1. Example Problem: A + B

Description

Given two integers A and B, compute and print A + B.

Input

‚Ä¢ Line 1: two integers A, B.

Output

‚Ä¢ One integer A + B.

Limits

‚Ä¢ 0 ‚â§ A,B ‚â§ 106.

Sample

Input Output

1 2 3

Explanation

Since 1 + 2 = 3, we output 3.

3.2. Solutions

Java

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ExampleProblem { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); int a = scanner.nextInt(); int b = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println(a + b);

scanner.close();

}

}

Python

line = input() tokens = line.split(‚Äò ‚Äò) a = int(tokens[0]) b = int(tokens[1]) print(a + b)

C

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)

{

int a, b; scanf(‚Äú%d%d‚Äù, a, b); print(‚Äú%d ‚Äú, a + b); return 0;

}

C++

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()

{

int a, b; std::cin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b; std::cout &lt;&lt; a + b &lt;&lt; std::endl;

return 0;
